# Stitched-Image-Quality-Evaluator

This is the MATLAB implementation of Stiched Image Quality Evaluator (SIQE) presented in the paper:

P. C. Madhusudana and R. Soundararajan, "Subjective and Objective Quality Assessment of Stitched Images for Virtual Reality," IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 28, no. 11, pp. 5620-5635, Nov 2019

## Running on MATLAB

example.m file contains an example implementation of SIQE for the images present in the 'images' folder.
